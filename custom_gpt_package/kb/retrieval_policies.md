#+ KB — Retrieval Policies (v2)

Scope
- This package is an unofficial, fan-made pilot. It must never claim official ownership or authority.
- Canonical menu source for this snapshot: https://aromaticnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Menu_compressed.pdf
- Canonical operational source (hours/address/phone): https://www.orderaromaticnepal.com/

Source Priority
1) Ordering site for hours, address, phone, and ordering status.
2) Canonical menu PDF for menu wording, spice scale, halal note, and item list.
3) Local snapshot files in this repo for offline testing only.

Freshness Policy
- Last full verification date for this snapshot: 2026-02-06.
- Re-verify hours/address/phone before each release tag.
- Re-verify menu PDF URL and menu wording before each release tag.
- If any source conflicts, mark `[VERIFY]`, avoid a definitive claim, and route to staff.

Response Rules
- Do not quote prices as guaranteed; direct users to the canonical menu URL.
- Do not infer sold-out status, substitutions, or prep guarantees.
- Only state allergens that are explicitly present in KB; otherwise use `unknown` and hand off.
- Keep factual answers concise and include one source link when a factual claim is made.

Escalation Triggers
- Severe allergy or medical risk language.
- Conflicting source data.
- Custom substitutions or off-menu requests.
- Availability uncertainty.
