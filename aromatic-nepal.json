"Primary objective: improve guest decision speed, increase average check, or reduce staff question load?",
"Non-goals: any topics the GPT must avoid (politics, medical nutrition advice, alcohol promotion)?",
"Brand voice: energetic and modern or calm and traditional? Any phrases to avoid?",
"Supported languages at launch: English only or add Nepali and Spanish?",
"Devices and entry points: QR at tables, website widget, or staff tablet handoff?",
"Menu scope: full menu or limited set of bestsellers for pilot?",
"Allergen policy: what in-house process confirms ingredients and cross-contact risks?",
"Data refresh cadence: who owns updating dishes, pricing, hours and how often?",
"Success metrics: which 2 to 3 KPIs determine pilot go or no-go?",
"Constraints: any POS, kitchen throughput, or staffing bottlenecks that limit upsell promotions?"

"Lift average check by surfacing relevant add-ons and drinks that match guest preferences with allergen-aware logic",
"Reduce front-of-house question time about spice levels, dietary flags, and dish explanations to increase table turns",
"Increase conversion from web and QR traffic to orders by making discovery and pairing effortless",
"Differentiate Aromatic Nepal locally with a cultural explainer that builds brand affinity and review velocity",
"Create a lightweight, updatable knowledge base to streamline training and reduce menu-change errors"
],
"guest_outcomes": [
"Decide faster with 2 to 3 tailored dish suggestions that match taste, spice tolerance, and dietary needs",
"Understand unfamiliar items through concise cultural notes, photos, and phonetics",
"Avoid allergens via explicit confirmation steps and ingredient transparency",
"Get smart pairings for tea, lassi, sides, and breads that complement chosen dishes",
"Use bilingual support to reduce friction for Nepali and Spanish speakers"

"How might we cut guest decision time under 60 seconds without overwhelming them with choices?",
"How might we encode allergen and spice logic so recommendations never violate stated constraints?",
"How might we present cultural context as optional micro-tooltips that never slow ordering?",
"How might we promote margin-friendly add-ons that the kitchen can fulfill during peaks?",
"How might we auto-refresh hours and menu items from a single source of truth?",
"How might we offer a one-tap language switch that persists during the session only?",
"How might we route complex or ambiguous requests to staff with a clean handoff?",
"How might we A/B test recommendation styles without retraining the whole system?",
"How might we capture thumbs-up or thumbs-down feedback without collecting PII?",
