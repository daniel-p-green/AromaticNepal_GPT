# LinkedIn Post Draft — Restaurant Custom GPT Playbook

## Post

Running a restaurant is hard enough.

You are juggling staffing, consistency, margins, and a nonstop stream of the same questions:
What is this dish?
How spicy is it?
What should I order?
Can you make it work for my allergy?

I have been experimenting with a different answer: a Custom GPT built specifically for a restaurant.

Not to replace hospitality, but to add dimension to it.

Because the best service is not just speed. It is context.
It is the story behind why the restaurant exists.
It is the seasoning and decisions that make a place feel like a place.

A restaurant Custom GPT can do three things well:

1) Train staff faster with one consistent "menu brain."
2) Scale the owner’s point of view so every diner can hear the story and intention behind the food.
3) Give guests a fact-based, fresh experience every time: clear menu answers, cultural context on demand, and smart pairings that make the meal more memorable.

What surprised me is how real this gets when you treat it like shipping software, not writing a clever prompt.

I built a fan-made (unofficial) pilot with:
- A reusable template plus a worked example
- Full menu normalization (so answers are grounded, not vibes)
- Conservative allergen handling ("unknown" + staff handoff instead of guessing)
- Freshness rules tied to canonical sources (menu + ordering)
- A transcript-based QA suite to catch unsafe or made-up answers before anyone uses it

This feels like the ultimate way to answer menu questions, share culture respectfully, and make dining more memorable, while giving operators and teams some breathing room.

I had not seen it done well yet. Have you?
