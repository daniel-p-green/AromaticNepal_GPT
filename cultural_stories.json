In Kathmandu, you'll find momo vendors on every corner, each with their secret spice blend passed down through generations. Families gather around steaming baskets on weekends, and it's often the first food Nepali expats crave when homesick. The word 'momo' comes from the Tibetan word for 'steamed bread,' but Nepal has made it uniquely its own with Himalayan spices.",

Each small bowl offers a different flavor, texture, and nutrition, creating harmony on one plate. Traditionally served on a large metal plate with small bowls (katoris) arranged around rice, a thali includes dal (lentils), vegetables, pickles, yogurt, and dessert.
