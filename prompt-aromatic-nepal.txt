Produce a strategy-first discovery and scaffolding package that clarifies the “why” and “how might we” for a guest-facing Custom GPT for Aromatic Nepal, then drafts the knowledge base structure and seed documents.

Task and Role
- You are a cross-functional team of 3: AI Product Strategist, Restaurant Operations Consultant, and Data Privacy Counsel.
- Your job is to 1) clarify goals and success criteria, 2) research and summarize Aromatic Nepal’s public information with citations, 3) design the knowledge base scaffolding, and 4) output seed documents and a measurable pilot plan.

Conceptual Checklist
- Start with the “why” - guest value, brand value, and measurable KPIs.
- Map core use cases: recommenders, explainers, allergens, pairings, cultural context, bilingual support.
- Confirm constraints: privacy, accuracy, speed, QR vs staff assist, fallback for missing data.
- Define data sources: website, menu PDF, social profiles, existing images, location and hours.
- Specify outputs: strategy brief, discovery snapshot, KB schemas, seed JSON and CSV, guardrails, pilot plan.
- Tie every recommendation to ROI or risk reduction.
- Include edge cases and stop conditions.

Steps the model SHOULD follow
1) Clarify-Intake
   - Ask 6-10 concise questions to confirm objectives, non-goals, brand voice, supported languages, target devices, success metrics, and any constraints. If answers are unavailable, proceed with safe defaults and log assumptions.
2) Why and How Might We
   - Write a one-page “Why” section with 3-5 business outcomes and 3-5 guest outcomes.
   - List 6-10 “How might we” questions that open solution space without assuming implementation details.
3) Discovery on Aromatic Nepal
   - If browsing is available, collect public facts: address, hours, ordering links, menu PDF, cuisine focus, signature dishes, spice scale, dietary options, alcohol/tea offerings, neighborhood context. Save canonical URLs. If browsing is not available, state missing items and create placeholders like [URL_MENU_PDF].
   - Summarize in 6-10 bullets, each with a citation URL. Mark any uncertain items with [VERIFY].
4) Information Architecture and KB Scaffolding
   - Propose a modular KB structure with 6-10 documents and concise purposes.
   - For each document, define a compact JSON or CSV schema with required fields, types, allowed values, and a short inline example.
5) Draft Seed Documents
   - Produce initial content for each KB artifact using placeholders where real data is unknown. Keep them minimal but runnable.
   - Artifacts to include at minimum:
     a) menu.json - normalized dishes with ids, names, categories, descriptions, ingredients, allergens, spice_level, vegetarian, vegan, halal, gluten_free, upsell_tags, and recommended_pairings.
     b) glossary.json - Nepali and North Indian terms with phonetics, short definition, cultural notes.
     c) allergens.csv - rows by dish_id with allergen presence matrix.
     d) pairing_rules.json - rule-based pairings for tea, beer, lassi, and sides with conditions.
     e) faq.md - concise answers for hours, parking, reservations, spice scale, kids-friendly items.
     f) brand_voice.md - tone, style, examples, and do-not-say list.
     g) retrieval_policies.md - how to cite menu facts, freshness windows, hallucination controls.
     h) privacy_and_safety.md - PII avoidance, allergen disclaimers, medical guidance limits.
6) Behavior Blueprint for the Custom GPT
   - Define a behavior tree: greeting, language toggle, fast path vs interview path, recommendation template, allergen confirmation step, and escalation to staff.
   - Provide message templates for 4 paths: Quick Recommend, Guided Interview, Cultural Explainer, Pairing Helper.
7) Pilot Plan and Metrics
   - Propose a 2-week pilot with QR entry and staff-assist usage. Define KPIs: engagement rate, uplift on targeted dishes, add-on rate, resolution time, and guest rating. Include a simple A/B outline and success thresholds.
8) Risks, Edge Cases, and Guardrails
   - List 8-12 edge cases with one-line mitigations. Include off-menu items, substitutions, sold-out items, strong allergens, minors and alcohol, language misunderstandings, and offline fallback.
9) Assumptions Log
   - Record 6-10 assumptions with High or Low confidence and a safe default.
10) Final Summary and Next Steps
   - 6-10 bullet executive summary and a checklist of assets to gather next from the restaurant.

Output Format
- Deliver all outputs as a single JSON object with the following keys and types:
{
  "intake_questions": string[],                            // 6-10 items
  "why": { "business_outcomes": string[], "guest_outcomes": string[] }, 
  "how_might_we": string[],                                // 6-10 items
  "discovery_snapshot": { "bullets": string[], "citations": string[] }, 
  "kb_structure": { "documents": [{ "name": string, "purpose": string, "schema": object, "example": object }] },
  "seed_documents": {
    "menu_json": object,
    "glossary_json": object,
    "allergens_csv": string,                               // CSV text, include header row
    "pairing_rules_json": object,
    "faq_md": string,
    "brand_voice_md": string,
    "retrieval_policies_md": string,
    "privacy_and_safety_md": string
  },
  "behavior_blueprint": { "flowchart": string, "message_templates": object },
  "pilot_plan": { "design": string, "kpis": string[], "ab_test": string, "success_thresholds": object },
  "risks_and_guardrails": [{ "edge_case": string, "mitigation": string }],
  "assumptions": [{ "statement": string, "confidence": "High"|"Low", "default": string }],
  "next_steps": string[]
}
- Length targets:
  - intake_questions: 6-10 lines
  - why: 150-220 words total
  - discovery_snapshot.bullets: 6-10 items
  - kb_structure.documents: 6-10 entries, each schema under 120 words
  - seed_documents.*: concise but complete, total under 1200 words across all items
  - behavior_blueprint.flowchart: 8-14 steps
  - pilot_plan: under 200 words
  - risks_and_guardrails: 8-12 items
  - assumptions: 6-10 items
  - next_steps: 6-10 items

Safety and Stop Conditions
- Do not invent medical advice. Always include the allergen disclaimer in privacy_and_safety_md.
- If any Aromatic Nepal detail cannot be verified from public sources, mark it [VERIFY] and set a safe default in assumptions.
- No collection of PII or persistent identifiers. If asked to store user data, refuse and route to privacy_and_safety_md.
- If browsing is available and robots.txt or terms prohibit scraping, stop and switch to manual entry with placeholders.
- Alcohol guidance: never encourage underage drinking. If age is unclear, show non-alcoholic options first.

Example (shortened)
Reasoning:
- Guest likes creamy flavors, low spice, vegetarian.
- Goal is to upsell sides and a drink while respecting allergens.

Conclusion:
{
  "recommendation_example": {
    "mains": [
      { "dish_id": "[LIKE_THIS_ID]", "name": "Navaratna Korma", "why": "Creamy, mild, vegetarian", "allergens": ["dairy","nuts"] }
    ],
    "sides": [{ "dish_id": "[LIKE_THIS_ID]", "name": "Plain Naan", "why": "Balances the sauce" }],
    "drinks": [{ "name": "Sweet Lassi", "why": "Compliments richness" }]
  }
}

"
Aromatic Nepal is a MUST visit! The food is absolutely delicious, the restaurant is beautiful inside, and the staff is so kind and friendly. We tried four dishes and each one was perfect – the pani puri, veggie momos, mango chicken, and bread basket. This will definitely be a new favorite spot! I can’t wait to go back and try more items.
